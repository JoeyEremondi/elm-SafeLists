This module provides a form of list which encode their length
in their type, using the TypeNats library. For example:

    someLength3 : List.Safe Int (OnePlus (OnePlus (OnePlus (Zero))) )
    someLength3 = 2 `cons` 3 `cons` 4 `cons` null

List whose length doesn't match their type are forbidden.
For example:

    --Gives type mismatch
    badLength3 : Safe Int (OnePlus (OnePlus  (Zero)) )
    badLength3 = 2 `cons` 3 `cons` 4 `cons` null

Because Elm doesn't have GADTs or DataKinds, it's impossible
to pattern match on SafeLists. Instead, we provide an "uncons"
function, which splits a list which we know to be non-empty
into its head and tail.

For example:

    sumFirstLast =
      let
        (h1, t1) = uncons someLength3
        (_, t2) = uncons t1
        (h3, t3) = uncons t2
        tailCheck : Safe Int Zero
        tailCheck = t3
      in
        h1 + h3

This notation is awkward, so it's assumed this library
will be used on small lists only.


As well, many functions on List.List have been ported over,
though filter, foldl and foldr are notably absent, as they
do not preserve the length of the list.

Because Elm is not a higher-kinded language, it is not generally
possible to use this library when you don't know your list size in advance,
unless only generic functions like `map` are used.

Given a mapping function and an initial context value,
traverse the list left to right, applying our map function with the previously

this restricted form of a fold.

Like mapr, but the resulting elements are in reverse order.

{-|
Just like List.scanl, except we now have a guarantee that we increase the list lenght
by exactly one, since we always put our initial value in the list.
